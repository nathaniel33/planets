This morning I have been listening to the Stylus Fantasticus.
I found the Musical Heritage Society release of the Nicholaus Harnoncourt
recordings of Four Partitas from Biber's Harmonia Artificioso-Arioso.
Then I listened to an episode of Harmonia about the Stylus Fantasticus,
which included Froberger and Frescobaldi, Bertali who was an Italian at the
Hapsburg court, Buxtehude and finished off with a wonderful piece from
Manfredo Kramer and the Rare Fruits Council performing the Dutch composer
David Peterson.
After that it is to Andrew Manze and Romanesca's recording of Johann Heinrich
Schmelzer's Violin Sonatas.
Romanesca also has an album of Italian Stylus Fantasticus violin music simply
entitled Phantasticus. It includes a piece for solo chitarrone (the Italian 
name for the Theorbe) composed by Kapsberger as well as a harpsichord piece
composed by Frescobaldi. 
Romanesca features on of my favorite lutenists, Nigel North.
Need to find a good set of Frescobaldi harpsichord recordings. Blandine
Verlet does have a disc on Astree.
