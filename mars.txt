Cold and dry, and everything is red.
What about Oliver Morton again?
He is an editor at the Economist who has a sci-fi interest in Climate Change.
I read his book The Planet Remade about geo-engineering, which also goes in
depth about the carbon cycle etc.
Looks like he has written a book on the moon and another on Mars, could be
interesting.
